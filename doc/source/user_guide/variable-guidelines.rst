Variable naming conventions
===========================

A variable name should adhere to the following conventions:

*  A *|* (pipe) character indicates levels of hierarchy.
*  Do not use spaces before and after the *|* character, but add a
   space between words (e.g., *Primary Energy|Non-Biomass Renewables*).
*  Do not use abbreviations (e.g, *PHEV*) unless strictly necessary.
*  Do not use abbreviations of statistical operations (*min*, *max*,
   *avg*) but always spell out the word.
*  All words must be capitalised (except for *and*, *w/*, *w/o*, etc.).
*  Add hierarchy levels where it might be useful in the future, e.g.,
   use *Electric Vehicle|Plugin-Hybrid* instead of *Plugin-Hybrid
   Electric Vehicle*.
*  Do not include words like *Level* or *Quantity* in the variable,
   because this should be clear from the context or unit.
