Overview
========

This package facilitates working with data templates that follow the format developed by
the `Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) <https://www.iamconsortium.org>`_.
It supports validation of scenario data and region processing, which consists of
renaming and aggregation of model "native regions" to "common regions" used in a project.

This package is based on the work initially done in the Horizon 2020 project
`openENTRANCE <https://openentrance.eu>`_, which aims to  develop, use and
disseminate an open, transparent and integrated  modelling platform for assessing
low-carbon transition pathways in Europe.

Refer to the `openENTRANCE/openentrance`_ repository on GitHub for more information.
