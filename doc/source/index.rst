Overview
========

This package facilitates working with codelists that follow the format developed by the
`Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) <https://www.iamconsortium.org>`_. It
supports validation of scenario data and region processing, which consists of renaming
and aggregation of model "native regions" to "common regions" used in a project.

Those two tasks are carried out by two classes:

#. The :class:`DataStructureDefinition` class handles the validation of scenario data.
   It contains data templates for *variables* (including units) and *regions* to be used
   in a model comparison or scenario exercise following the IAMC data format.

#. The :class:`RegionProcessor` class carries out renaming and aggregation based on
   information given in model mapping files.

A starting point on how to use these two classes with existing data templates and model mappings can be found in :ref:`getting-started`.

A more ground-up view including the structures for data templates and model mappings is
given in :ref:`usage`.

This package is based on the work initially done in the Horizon 2020 project
`openENTRANCE <https://openentrance.eu>`_, which aims to  develop, use and
disseminate an open, transparent and integrated  modelling platform for assessing
low-carbon transition pathways in Europe.

Refer to the `openENTRANCE/openentrance`_ repository on GitHub for more information.
