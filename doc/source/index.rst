Overview
--------

The **nomenclature** package facilitates validation and processing of scenario data
for model comparison projects and scenario analysis. It allows to manage
project templates and "codelists" that follow the format developed by the
`Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) <https://www.iamconsortium.org>`_.

A "codelist" is a list allowed values (or "codes") for dimensions of IAMC-format data,
typically *regions* and *variables*. Each code can have additional attributes:
for example, a "variable" (string) usually has a definition and an expected unit.
Read the `SDMX Guidelines <https://sdmx.org/?page_id=4345>`_ for more information on
the concept of codelists.

The **nomenclature** package supports three main use cases:

- Management of codelists, definitions and mappings for model comparison projects
- Validation of scenario data against the codelists of a specific project
- Region-processing (aggregation and renaming) from "native regions" of a model to
  "common regions" (i.e., regions that are used for scenario comparison in a project).

The codelists, definitions and mappings are stored as yaml files.
Refer to the :ref:`user_guide` for more information.

This package is based on the work initially done in the Horizon 2020 project
`openENTRANCE <https://openentrance.eu>`_, which aims to  develop, use and
disseminate an open, transparent and integrated  modelling platform for assessing
low-carbon transition pathways in Europe.

Refer to the `openENTRANCE/openentrance`_ repository on GitHub for more information.
