## Overview

This package facilitates working with data templates that follow the format developed by
the [Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC)](https://www.iamconsortium.org).

## The pyam package

This package is intended to complement the Python package **pyam**,
an open-source community toolbox for analysis & visualization of scenario data.
That package was developed to facilitate working with timeseries scenario data
conforming to the format developed by the IAMC .
It is used in ongoing assessments by the IPCC and in many model comparison
projects at the global and national level, including several Horizon 2020 projects.
