## Overview

This package facilitates working with data templates that follow the format developed by
the [Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC)](https://www.iamconsortium.org).

## The pyam package

<img src="./_static/pyam-logo.png" width="133" height="100" align="right" alt="pyam logo" />

This package is intended to complement the Python package **pyam**,
an open-source community toolbox for analysis & visualization of scenario data.
That package was developed to facilitate working with timeseries scenario data
conforming to the format developed by the IAMC .
It is used in ongoing assessments by the IPCC and in many model comparison
projects at the global and national level, including several Horizon 2020 projects.

[Read the docs](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io) for more information!

## Getting started

To install this package, please install Python version 3.7 or higher. Then,
download or git-clone this repository and run the following command in the root folder:

```
pip install --editable .
```

Then, open a Python console and import a suitable nomenclature structure from a folder
and run the following code to inspect the variables defined in the nomenclature.

```python
import nomenclature
nc = nomenclature.Nomenclature()
nc.variable
```

This package is based on the work initially done in the
[Horizon 2020 openENTRANCE](https://openentrance.eu) project, which aims to  develop,
use and disseminate an open, transparent and integrated  modelling platform
for assessing low-carbon transition pathways in Europe.
